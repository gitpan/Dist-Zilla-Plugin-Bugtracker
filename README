NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Bugtracker - Automatically sets the bugtracker URL
    and mailto

VERSION
    version 1.111080

SYNOPSIS
    In "dist.ini":

        [Bugtracker]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin sets the distribution's bugtracker URL and possibly the
    email address as metadata. You can set the "web" and the "mailto" values
    independently in the plugin configuration.

METHODS
  web
    This is the bugtracker URL. It defaults to the CPAN RT URL, so it
    equivalent to:

        [Bugtracker]
        web = http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=%s

    See "interpolate()" for more information.

  mailto
    This is the optional email address to which bug reports can be sent. If
    the CPAN RT bugtracker is used, the email address defaults to "bug-%l at
    rt.cpan.org" - see "interpolate()" for what this means.

    If a different bugtracker URL is used, the email address is only
    included in the metadata if it is explicitly given.

    In the following examples, assume that the distribution is called
    "Foo-Bar".

    Example 1:

        [Bugtracker]

    will produce the defaults:

        web:    http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Foo-Bar
        mailto: bug-foo-bar at rt.cpan.org

    Example 2:

    To suppress the "mailto" from example 1, use:

        [Bugtracker]
        mailto =

    Example 3:

        [Bugtracker]
        web = http://github.com/me/%s/issues

    will only produce a "web" entry, but not a "mailto" entry:

        web: http://github.com/me/Foo-Bar/issues

    Example 4:

        [Bugtracker]
        mailto = me@example.org

    will produce:

        web:    http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Foo-Bar
        mailto: me@example.org

    Example 5:

        [Bugtracker]
        web = http://github.com/me/%s/issues
        mailto = bug-%U@example.org

    will only produce a "web" entry, but not a "mailto" entry:

        web:    http://github.com/me/Foo-Bar/issues
        mailto: bug-FOO-BAR@example.org

    See CPAN::Meta::Spec
    <http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPAN-Meta/lib/CPAN/Meta/Spec.pm#resources>
    for more information.

  interpolate
    Both the "web" and "mailto" strings are interpolated as follows:

        %s  The distribution name as is (e.g., 'Foo-Bar')
        %l  The distribution name in lowercase (e.g., 'foo-bar')
        %U  The distribution name in uppercase (e.g., 'FOO-BAR')
        %%  A literal '%' sign

  metadata
    Sets the bugtracker URL and possibly email address in the distribution's
    metadata.
